# Numerical Analysis

Numerical Analysis is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the development and implementation of numerical algorithms to solve mathematical problems. These algorithms use computational methods to approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically or that are too difficult or time-consuming to solve by hand.

In this repository, I covered some numerical methods that have their own advantages and disadvantages over one another, according to the problem we are trying to solve. 

**Covered Methods:**

* Secant 
* Bisecant 
* Fixed-point
* Newton
* Lagrange 
* Forward-Differences 
* Backward-Differences
* Fibonacci sequence calculator

## Applications of Numerical Analysis

Numerical Analysis has a wide range of applications in various fields, including:

- Engineering: Numerical methods are used to analyze and design structures, materials, and systems in engineering.
- Finance: Numerical methods are used to value financial instruments and analyze financial data.
- Physics: Numerical methods are used to simulate physical systems and solve complex problems in physics.
- Biology: Numerical methods are used to model biological systems and analyze biological data.
- Computer Science: Numerical methods are used to develop algorithms and analyze data in computer science.

## Tools and Software

Numerical Analysis involves the use of various software tools and programming languages, such as MATLAB, Python, and R. These tools provide numerical algorithms and visualization tools to help users solve problems and analyze data. In addition, there are numerous libraries and packages available for numerical analysis in these languages, such as NumPy, SciPy, and MATLAB's toolbox.

This repository is specifically focusing on the implementation of numerical analysis methods using **MATLAB**.
